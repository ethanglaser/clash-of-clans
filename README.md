# clash-of-clans
Code implemented using the Clash of Clans API features

# Overview

These JavaScript files allow for organization of clan and account achievements, stats, etc. using the [Clash of Clans API](https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/).

# Getting Started

The first step is to create an account for the API. In order to use the API, authorization is needed using a JSON Web Token, which can be generated [here](https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/account). In order to generate the token, the user must be logged into their developer account and include the IP address of the device that will be used to access the API.

# API features

The base API URL is *https://api.clashofclans.com/v1/*. All API calls will be based off of this base.
